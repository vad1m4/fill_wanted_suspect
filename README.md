# Description
This script fills a template for a wanted poster.
I made it purely to enhance my LSPDFR experience, I don't know how can it be used in other cases, but yeah. 
Decided to upload this just for myself tbh, but maybe somebody would find this useful so I made it public

# UI VERSION IS WIP
**It's unusable at the moment, but it will be soon**

# How to use
1. If you have a mugshot, upload it to the "mugshots" folder and make sure the file's name is the suspect's **EXACT full name in all lowercase**, otherwise it won't work
2. Run the non_ui_main.py file and simply answer all of the questions. Tip: don't write the postal when it asks for the location of the incident, it will ask for postal in the next question
3. After it says "Done with *your suspect's name*", you can check the .docx file in the "wanted" folder and make corrections if needed.



*fun fact: most of the numbers you see at the bottom of the page are hookers' numbers xd*
